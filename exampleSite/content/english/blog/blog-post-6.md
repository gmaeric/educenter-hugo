### Advantages Of LED Street Light

1, LED street light characteristics, light, no light diffusion, ensure light efficiency;  
2, LED street light has a unique optical design of the two, the LED street light irradiation to the desired lighting area, further improve the efficiency of light, in order to achieve the purpose of energy conservation;  
3, LED light source efficiency has reached 100lm/W, but there is still much room for development, the theoretical value of 250lm/W. The luminous efficiency of high pressure sodium lamp is only increased with the increase of the power, therefore, the overall optical efficiency of LED lamp is better than high voltage sodium lamp is strong;  
4, LED street light color is much higher than that of high pressure sodium lamp, high pressure sodium lamp color index is only about 23, while the LED lamp color index reached more than 75, from the point of view of visual psychology, achieve the same brightness, illumination LED lamp can average 20% lower than high pressure sodium (with reference to the British standard lighting principle);  
One  
5, LED street light a small decline, a year decline of less than 3%, 10 years still reached the road illumination requirements, and high pressure sodium lamp failure, a year has decreased by more than 30%, therefore, LED lamps used in the design of power can be lower than high pressure sodium lamp;  
6, LED street light with automatic control energy saving device, can meet the requirements of lighting in different periods of time to reduce the maximum possible power, save energy;  
7, the LED is a low voltage driving device, single LED safe voltage, series of single LED power is 1 watts, so it is safer than the use of high voltage power supply, especially suitable for public places (such as street lighting, industrial lighting, automotive lighting, lighting and other people);  
8, each unit LED chip is only a small volume, so it can be prepared into various shapes of the device, and suitable for volatile environment.  
9, long life: can use more than 50 thousand hours, provide quality assurance for three years.  
10, high light efficiency by more than 100LM above the chip, compared with the traditional high pressure sodium lamp can save 75%.  
11, the installation is simple: without buried cable without rectifier, directly to the street lamp installed in the lamp or light source connected to the original nested shell.  
12, excellent heat control: summer temperature control at around 45 degrees, and the use of passive cooling mode.  
13, the quality is reliable: the circuit power supply all uses the high quality components, each LED has the independent overcurrent protection, does not need to worry about the damage.  
14, color uniformity: without lens, not to increase the brightness and uniform light color so as to ensure no sacrifice, iris color uniformity.  
According to the above principle, the energy saving effect of high power LED lamp significantly, instead of high pressure sodium lamp can save more than 60%.  
Maintenance cost is low: compared with the traditional street lamp, LED street light maintenance costs are very low, after comparison, less than 2 years to recover the full cost of inputs.
