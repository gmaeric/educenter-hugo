The critical requirements for PV modules are:

  
 *Type of PV modules must be crystalline silicon, either mono-C-Si or Poly C-Si;

 *The PV module must be certified by IEC 61215; IEC 61730 and the valid certificates must be provided.  
 *The PV module efficiency (full size) must not be less than 14%.  
 *The lifetime of the selected PV modules should be longer than 25 years. The degradation within first year must not be less than 3%.  
 *The warrantee period for PV Module must be at least 10 years against a maximum 10% reduction of output power at STC.  
 The manufacturer’s serial number should be inside the glass of PV Module.
