### LED Street Light

LED street light is an important part of city lighting, traditional street lamps used high-pressure sodium lamp, the overall light low pressure sodium lamp caused a huge waste of energy, therefore, the development of efficient, energy saving, long life, high color rendering index, environmental protection is very important for city street lamp lighting energy-saving significance.

High power LED street light and high pressure sodium lamp is different from conventional light source, high power LED street light with low voltage DC power supply, by the synthesis of GaN based blue LED and yellow fluorescent powder, white LED, with high efficiency, safety, energy saving, environmental protection, long life, fast response speed, high color rendering index unique advantages and can be widely used in city road lighting.

Light emitting diodes (LightEmittingDiode, abbreviated as LED) is a semiconductor pn junction formed with weak electricity can light high efficiency solid-state light source based on the forward bias voltage and the injected current, injected into the P region of the hole and injected into the N region electron in diffusion into the active region after radiation and emit a photon, electric can be directly converted into light energy.
