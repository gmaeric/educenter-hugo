### Street Light Pole

Street Light Pole Scope

This Specification covers the design, fabrication, testing and supply of fully galvanized tubular steel poles to be used for solar street lights.

### Street Light Pole General

The steel street light pole shall be designed and fabricated to withstand the wind velocity of 160km/hr. with all the necessary supporting load and accessories (Battery, Solar Module etc.).  
The steel tubular poles must be manufactured by a company approved to quality standard ISO 9001:2000. The ISO 9001 certification number, the name of the authorized approving authority with the contact address and telephone and fax numbers shall also be stated.

### Street Light Pole Description

![Street Light Pole](http://www.topsolarlighting.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Street-Light-Pole.jpg "Street Light Pole" =300x542)

Street Light Pole

The steel street light poles shall be of single tubing design.  
The steel tubing used in pole fabrication shall be of steel of any approved process possessing a minimum tensile strength of 42 kg/sq. mm and a chemical composition of not more than 0.06% sulphur and not more than 0.06% phosphorous.  
It shall be the responsibility of the supplier to determine the adequacy of the component tubing shown for the load to be sustained.

All tubes forming parts of the above supports shall be made from hot insulated seamless or continuously welded steel in accordance with BS 6323 or equivalent applicable Standards.

The street light poles shall be fully galvanized with minimum coating of weight not less than 460gm/sq. m internally and externally.  
Each street light pole shall be provided with a steel top plate 3-mm minimum thickness welded to the end of the section. The top plate shall not project beyond the perimeter of the top section. Each pole shall also be provided with a welded base plate welded to the bottom of the pole.  
The size of the base plate shall be as per governing standard and design requirements.

### Street light pole Tolerance

The following tolerances shall be maintained:  
a) Tolerance of diameter: +/-1%  
b) Tolerance on weight: +/-1% on each pole.  
c) Tolerance on thickness: +/-1%

### Soalr Street Light Pole Tests

The following test(s) shall be performed for the pole furnished.  
Number of poles selected for conducting tensile test and chemical analysis for sulphur and phosphorous shall be as given below:  
Lot Size No.of poles  
Up to 500 1  
501 to 1000 2  
1001 to 2000 3  
2001 to 3000 4  
3001 and above 5  
Number of street light poles selected or conducting deflection test, permanent set test shall be as given below:

Lot Size No. of poles  
Up to 500 5  
501 to 1000 8  
1001 to 2000 13  
2001 to 3000 18  
3001 and above 20

The deflection test and permanent set test shall be conducted in succession on each of the poles selected.

### Deflection Test

Each street light pole shall be rigidly supported for a distance from the butt end equal to the depth which it is to be planted in the ground. It shall then be loaded as cantilever and the guaranteed deflection load applied at right angles of the axis of pole 60 cm from the top. For convenience in testing, the pole may be fixed horizontally and the load applied vertically. The temporary deflection due to the applied load at the point of application of load shall not exceed 157.5 mm.

### Work Requirements

zero position after the release of the appropriate applied load at the point of application of the load shall not exceed 13 mm.

Should of any of the poles selected fail to pass any of the tests specified above two further poles shall be selected for testing from the same lot in respect of each failure. Should both these additional poles fail, the test material represented by the test samples shall be deemed as not complying with these specifications.
